# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Grady-Saccullo

I'm a Lead Computer Lingusitc Engineer at [@Voze](https://github.com/Voze-HQ) and [@Seer AI](https://github.com/Seer-AI).

Currently working with TypeSript, NextJS, Auth0, Supbase, Monorepos, and AWS CDK.

If I could only use my fav langs would be TypeScript, Go, and Rust.

## Some items I find tantalizing:
- Hey Docker... How does one compose?
- ÂµServices
- Roll your own (Sometimes... Know your dependecy chains)
- Networking (It's what go me started)
- PnP (Codebase, I am your inteface)
- ÂµControllers/ÂµElectonics
