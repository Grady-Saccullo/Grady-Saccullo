I'm a Lead Computer Lingusitc Engineer at [@Voze](https://voze.com) working with CDK, TypeSript, and React.

If I could only use my fav langs would be TypeScript, Go, and Rust.

## Some items I find tantalizing:
- Hey Docker... How does one compose?
- ÂµServices
- Roll your own (Sometimes... Know your dependecy chains)
- Networking (It's what go me started)
- PnP (Codebase, I am your inteface)
- ÂµControllers/ÂµElectonics
